# Fall-Themed ESP32 Display Project
Creative Embedded Systems, Module 1: Generative Art (Fall-Themed)

**Project Objective**

In this project, I aimed to generate a fall-themed art display using an ESP32 microcontroller. Since this was my first time using an ESP32, the art is quite rudimentary, but it was a great learning experience! I wanted to program the ESP32’s built-in display to depict colored leaves falling “down” the screen. I also had the opportunity to demo this artwork in the Barnard library (picture below)!

This was my final project within the envelope for display. The envelope is open in the image to show the full artwork. This artwork was modeled off of Central Park, with a long walking path, fall foliage on either side, and a lake with canoes and turtles.

Here is the whole class's art installation in a Barnard library!

**Project Takeaways**

This project turned out to be more difficult than I had initially expected. My original vision was to display fall leaves on top of a background image of the skyscrapers and foliage behind Central Park. However, despite a lot of experimentation, I was unable to get the background image to display alongside the fall leaves graphics. Working with these leaves was also quite difficult. First, I had to figure out how to represent a leaf using simple shapes. Next, I wanted to time the leaves so they would each start falling at different times, however, it proved to be very difficult to run more complex loops with graphics on the ESP32 (and it often crashed, displaying nothing). Thus, I ended up with this simplified fall foliage on a brown background. Although the final product is a bit more basic than I had envisioned, I am proud of my learning journey through this experience!
